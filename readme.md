# Masters Dissertation

## This Repo serves as a documentation to my progress in research.
## Title: Classification of Diabetic Foot Ulcers from Thermogram

Created On: Wednesday 25 September 2024

Research was started from 'May' its been 5 months

### Logs

- Thought about working in NLP.
- Switched to DFU Classification as suggested by supervisor.
- Read paper as assigned to me by sir.[^1] [^2]
- Implemented first paper which stated the use of shallow learning for classification [^1] [^3]
- Spend 2 Months understanding approach of GLCM
- Creating various visualization.
- Refined methodology to increase accuracy (mainly segmenting the image).
- Max Accuracy: 88% SVM [Without Normalization]
- Started learning 'Deep Learning' with course 'Deep Learning for Computer Vision'


# Reflection

Initially this work seemed intimidating but throughout this i seemed to gain and refined valuable skills

- better workflow to create work summary and ppt [learned Pandoc]
- different ways of visualization
- develop quite good intuition (as i feel) of shallow learning
- how to find research documents

also i have good enough personal space to carry out research work.
my progress might seems slow, it was mainly due to personal reasons and quite a lot of lack in knowledge.


# Whats next 

- currently i am undertaking a course 'Deep Learning for Computer Vision : IIT Hyderabad - NPTEL'.


# Tools i use

- Research Rabbit: Recommandation system but for research paper (atleast that how i was told it is) (still getting familar withit).
- nvim : great editor and incredibly versatile.
- pandoc: compile various documents (ppt, work summary etc) from simple markdown.
- jupyter notebook: pretty well known

# Learning Resources

- yet to be done.

PS: i realize that saying i have gained good intiuition and not normalizing data for svm is contradicting, i will do that soon enough
