1. Implemented Patched Approach for GLCM Classification which improved the accuracy upto 88%.

2. During i was at home, wasnt able to carry out any research related work.

3. After returning i started to learn Deep Learning and started implementing basic MLP model for classification,
also learning pytorch.

# Target For September

i wasnt able to hit any target of aug that i listed in my previous report to i will continue them and complete them this month

1. Read all Backlog Papers
2. Understand and Implement CNN and GAN Network For Classification
